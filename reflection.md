Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
In all classes, I overloaded the Constructors in case, someone didn't have trival information like whether a building has an elevator. It also allows someone to use the methods with as little info as the name of the building. So you can for example add books to a library you only know the name of.

In Cafe, I also overloaded the sellCoffee method, so the barista doesn't have to input 0 into the method if the customer don't want any cream.
In House, I also overloaded the moveIn method, so that even if we don't know the name of student moving in, the residents ArrayList is the accurate size.
In Library I also overloaded the addTitle method, so that once again we have the accurate count of books in the library.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think it made a lot of sense! I think the exmaples in class very super helpful especially the lazy dog vs the zoomy dog. I was a little confused about making the assignment under A8 or simply modifying the A7 assignment.
